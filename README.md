# Balance-Scale-Tip-Classifier
Classify the position of Balance Scale tip based off Balance Scale Dataset from UCI ML Repo
The aim of our project is to classify the position of Balance Scale based off the Balance Scale Data Set from UCI ML Repository

We will use Tree methods under scikit-learn for the classification task.
Then we try on ensemble models to see weather we can get better accuracy with them.
